		"abstract": "The widespread integration of machine learning systems into high-impact domains, including healthcare diagnostics, financial risk assessment, and judicial decision support, has escalated concerns regarding transparency, accountability, and societal trust. While complex, high-performance models often operate as \"black boxes,\" their opacity poses significant ethical, legal, and operational challenges, particularly when automated decisions directly affect human welfare. This study proposes a comprehensive, three-tiered conceptual and applied framework for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) that systematically integrates intrinsic model transparency, post-hoc interpretability, and human-centered explanation design. We critically examine prevailing XAI methodologies, delineate their theoretical foundations and practical limitations, and introduce a structured, context-sensitive methodology for deploying interpretable machine learning in real-world systems. Through applied case studies in clinical risk prediction and credit scoring, we demonstrate that carefully designed explainability mechanisms can substantially enhance user trust, facilitate regulatory compliance, and improve decision quality without necessitating a significant compromise in predictive accuracy. Our findings underscore the critical importance of contextualized, stakeholder-specific explanations and advocate for interdisciplinary collaboration as a cornerstone for the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence.",
