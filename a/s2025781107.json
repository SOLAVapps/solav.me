		"abstract": "The digital paradigm in scholarly publishing has precipitated a shift from rigid, issue, based models toward dynamic, article, based workflows. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the continuous publication model, a system where manuscripts are published individually upon final acceptance, decoupling dissemination from the assembly of static journal issues. Through a qualitative synthesis of publishing policies, scholarly literature, and case studies, this paper elucidates the model's conceptual underpinnings, its tangible benefits in accelerating research dissemination and enhancing accessibility, and the concomitant editorial, ethical, and infrastructural complexities. We identify critical challenges including metadata integrity, version control, archival permanence, and citation consistency. In response, this article makes a novel contribution by proposing the TAP (Temporal, Administrative, Perceptual) Framework for evaluating publication models and outlining a “Multi, Layer Archival” strategy for digital preservation. The findings offer a critical, practical guide for editors, publishers, and scholarly communications specialists seeking to implement or optimize continuous publication, with particular relevance for emerging open, access journals navigating the evolving topology of academic publishing.",
