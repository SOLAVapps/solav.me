		"abstract": "The digital transformation of scholarly communication has reshaped how research is produced, disseminated, evaluated, and preserved. Central to this transformation are open access publishing models, evolving peer review practices, and renewed attention to research ethics and transparency. This conceptual research article examines the contemporary scholarly publishing landscape, focusing on the normative foundations of open access, the role of journals as ethical stewards, and the challenges faced by emerging digital-first publications. Drawing on existing literature and policy frameworks, the article argues that academic journals must move beyond traditional gatekeeping roles and actively cultivate inclusive, accountable, and sustainable knowledge ecosystems. The paper proposes a principled framework for ethical digital publishing that emphasizes accessibility, editorial independence, research integrity, and long-term stewardship of scholarly knowledge.",
